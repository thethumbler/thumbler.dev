{{< quote "Miguel de Cervantes, Don Quixote" >}}Let your worship keep count of the goats the fisherman is taking across, for if one escapes the memory there will be an end of the story, and it will be impossible to tell another word of it.{{< /quote >}}

You are a nomadic shepherd. In order to keep accurate records and to be alert to instances of straying, shepherds must perform frequent head-counts of their flocks. 

You didn't do the counting. The stones did it. Surely, you carried them from one pile to another, but the stones--themselves--had to carry the extremley complicated task of maintaing their physical state so that you can use them for counting.

Here is a simple experiment, grab a ruler, and do the following:
* draw a line that spans from 0 to 5,
* move the ruler such that the 0 starts at the end of the line,
* draw a line that spans from 0 to 6 as a straight continuation to the first line,
* put the ruler back such that the 0 starts at the start of the entire line,
* record the number you see at the end of the line.

You got 11, or 5+6. While it's obvious to _you_, you didn't have to know what 0, 5, 6 or 11 even are, you didn't have to know anything about counting or addition. You just had to carry a (relatively) simple set of operations in order without thinking. That's exactly what a computer is[^1]. Except of course, it has to be a machine. Tracing back the origins of the word _computer_, it comes from the latin computƒÅre, which--among multiple meanings--literally means _to count_.



[^1]: Well, not exactly, you'll have to define which sets of "rules" are allowed, and how it should carry them, but that's for later.
